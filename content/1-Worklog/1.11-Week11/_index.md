### Week 11 Objective: Proposal, Cost Estimation, Finalize Documentation

#### Work activities

- Wrote the proposal:

  - Project overview
  - AWS architecture
  - Data flow
  - Estimated cost
  - Reasons for technology choices

- Estimated AWS costs based on assumed traffic:

  - Data ingestion cost (Kinesis)
  - Compute (Lambda)
  - Storage (S3)
  - ETL/Query (Glue, Athena)

- Revised and finalized the project report for submission.

#### Results

- Proposal is nearly complete (some sections still need refinement).
- Cost estimation is reasonably constructed based on the usage model.
- Deliverables are almost fully completed.
