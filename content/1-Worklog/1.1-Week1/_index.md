### Week 1 Achievements:

- Understanding Cloud Computing:

  - Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet.
  - Pay-as-you-go model, costs based on usage.
  - Cost optimization: only pay for what you use, with high speed.
  - Flexible in adding or reducing resources as needed.
  - Global scale, widely applicable across the world.

- How to learn Cloud Computing:

  - Learn and share knowledge with peers, and gain experience from those with more expertise.
  - Practice by using AWS services.
  - Learn through self-study on online platforms.

- Creating an AWS account and understanding AWS tools:

  - Successfully created an account and received $200 after completing activation tasks.
  - Gained a clear understanding of the difference between Root User and IAM User:
  - Root User is the main account that manages everything. IAM Users are created by the Root User and assigned permissions.
  - Set up MFA for the account to ensure security.

- Create user:
  - To create a user, go to the AWS console and search for **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.
  - Then youâ€™ll see its Dashboard; pay attention to two sections: **Users** and **User Groups**.
  - To create a user, select Users and click **create user**.
  - Enter the username and check **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional**. To create a password, select **I want to create an IAM user** => **I want to create an IAM user** => **Next**.
  - Click Next, then finally Create user.
- Create user:
  - To create a User Group, go to the AWS console and search for **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.
  - Select **User Groups** => **Create user group** => **Enter a group name and create it**.
  - Open the group you just created, choose Add user, select the user you want to add, and then add the user.
