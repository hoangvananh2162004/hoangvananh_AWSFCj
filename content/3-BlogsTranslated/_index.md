### [Blog 1 - Extending deployment pipelines with Amazon ECS blue green deployments and lifecycle hooks.](3.1-Blog1/)

The blog introduces how to extend application deployment pipelines with Amazon ECS blue/green deployments combined with lifecycle hooks. Blue/green enables safe traffic shifting between two environments, while lifecycle hooks (Lambda functions inserted into each deployment stage) add custom logic such as testing, validation, or manual approval. This allows businesses to gain better control over the deployment process, reduce risks, and easily roll back in case of issues.

### [Blog 2 - Accelerate serverless testing with LocalStack integration in VS Code IDE](3.2-Blog2/)

The blog introduces the integration of LocalStack into AWS Toolkit for VS Code, enabling developers to easily test and debug serverless applications locally without deploying to AWS. This makes the development, integration testing, and deployment of serverless applications faster, more convenient, and more seamless directly within the IDE.

### [Blog 3 - Build centralized cross-Region backup architecture with AWS Control Tower](3.3-Blog3/)

The blog explains how to build a centralized cross-Region backup architecture by integrating AWS Backup with AWS Control Tower. When this integration is enabled, Control Tower automatically creates centralized backup vaults in each Region within a “central backup” account, along with local vaults in each workload account. Using backup policies, you can configure local or cross-Region backups and apply them consistently across the entire organization—reducing operational complexity, ensuring compliance, and enhancing data resiliency.
