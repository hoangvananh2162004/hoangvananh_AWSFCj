## Identity & Access Management (IAM)

IAM is a foundational AWS service for controlling secure access.

### Key Responsibilities of IAM

- Secure access control
- Management of **users**, **groups**, **roles**, and **permissions**
- Ensuring both **authentication** and **authorization**

### Example IAM Structure

- **Developers** – e.g., Susan
- **Security** – e.g., Dave
- **Admins** – e.g., Bob

Each group carries different authorization levels.

## Best Practices for IAM

To maintain secure AWS environments, it is recommended to:

- Apply the **Least Privilege Principle**
- Delete **root access keys** immediately after creation
- Use IAM Users or Roles instead of the root account for daily operations
- Avoid using the `"*"` wildcard in policies
- Use `aws login` properly
